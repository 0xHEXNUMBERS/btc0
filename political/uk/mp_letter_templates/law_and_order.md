// Main points

1. Ability to avoid international sanctions 

2. Enabling cyber crime especially ransomware but also other types of fraud. 

Cryptocurrencies provide limited value to end consumers as virtually no merchants accept them as payment, however their quasi anonymous nature and the ability
to sidestep traditional financial institutions make them a perfect form of payment for cybercriminals. As cryptocurrencies have grown in popularity and value so
too has the rate of cybercrime, especially that of ransomware. Ransomware, typically takes the form of a virus which locks legitimate users out of computer systems
and data demanding payment in cryptocurrency to return access. This form of attack can have deadly consequences with hospitals and other public services being 
targeted alongside private companies and home users. Taking away the ease by which victims can pay attackers will significantly reduce the ability for criminals to
profit from these crimes and go a long way in reducing their occurrence.
