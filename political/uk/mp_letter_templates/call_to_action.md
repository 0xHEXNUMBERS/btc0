The UK is positioning itself as a world leader in the fight against climate change, however all the work we have done so far is being undermined by the continued 
growth of proof of work based crypto currencies. Tackling this problem would give significant and immediate returns in the fight agaisnt climate change with 
limited downsides. At the moment, all cryptocurrencies rely on being freely exchangable for world currencies as their penetration into the market for direct payments
is very limited. This gives a unique opportunity to shut Bitcoin down before it can do any further damage by cutting it off from the global banking network and 
prohibiting crypto currency exchanges from operating. 

In November, the UK will be hosting the COP 26 summit for climate change. This presents an ideal oportunity for the UK to take a stand against the horrifically 
wasteful cryptocurrency industry and further demonstrate it's status as a world leader on tackling climate change. As my MP I hope that you can take this position
foward and work together with your collegues in parliament to achieve this goal.
