// Intended for all, probably needs a complete rewrite per country but elements will remain the same

The UK is positioning itself as a world leader in the fight against climate change. However, all the work we have done so far is being undermined by the continued 
growth of proof-of-work based digital tokens; which are commonly referred to by the misnomer crypto “currencies”. Tackling this problem would give significant and immediate returns in the fight agaisnt climate change with limited downsides. At the moment, all cryptocurrencies rely on being freely exchangable for fiat currencies as their penetration into the market for direct payments is very limited. This gives a unique opportunity to shut Bitcoin down before it can do any further damage by cutting it off from the global banking network and prohibiting crypto currency exchanges from operating. 

// Focusing on proof-of-work tokens makes it seems as if proof-of-stake is any better. Environmentally yes, but they remain greed inducing pyramid Ponzi schemes.

In November, the UK will be hosting the COP 26 summit for climate change. This presents an ideal oportunity for the UK to take a stand against the significantly 
wasteful crypto currency industry and further demonstrate its status as a world leader on tackling climate change. As my MP I hope that you can take this position
forward and work together with your colleagues in parliament to achieve this goal.
