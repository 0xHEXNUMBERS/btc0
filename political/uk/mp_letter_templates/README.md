This directory contains snippets to join together to produce a letter to your MP. The idea is that the letter can be tailored to each MP's party and policy stances
so that we can build cross party support for this position. Suggested snippets are:

### Conservative

intro.md
what_is_bitcoin.md
environmental.md (short version if multiple versions)
law_and_order.md
call_to_action.md

### Labour/Green

intro.md
what_is_bitcoin.md
environmental.md (longer version if multiple versions)
social.md
call_to_action.md

* For Shadow Justice ministers and Leader of the opposition include law & order section as well

### Lib dem/SNP/Plaid Cymru

Probably use Labour/Green template unless you think the conservative template would fit a specific MP better

### Northen Ireland parties

I'm insufficiently aware of NI politics to make suggestions here, hopefully someone from NI can make some. 

for Sinn FÃ©in the call to action will need reworking slightly as they do not take up their seats in parliament.

## Further work

- Produce a set of snippets to use for any rebuttals if MPs come back with crypto talking points like Blockchain being an innovative technology (it's not) 
or that Bitcoin is driving renewable energy takeup (even if it did, we'd be better using that energy for literally anythign else)
- Produce a set of snippets to add to replies for MPs who want more information on one or more topics
- A mechanism to track which MPs have been contacted and any replies from them
- Tips/pointers for in person meetings
