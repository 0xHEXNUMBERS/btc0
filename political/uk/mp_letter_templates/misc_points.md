// Few other points we may want to make and expand on for some target audiences

1. Impact on free hosting/CI services from miners 
// Two directions for this - impact on businesses marketing and sales pipelines
// Impact on free tools for education & open source projects 

2. Impact on manufacturing pipelines and shortages of GPUs etc as they are being diverted for mining efforts
// Could also add that SSDs are next due to a new cryptocurrency...

3. Exposure of companies esp finacial ones to a crash if growth continues the way its going
// Could trigger next financial crisis

4. No consumer protections (eg against fraud)
// Two directions here, the first against rogue merchants - not easy to get money back if something goes wrong
// Second against criminal fraud - banks currently have the ability to reverse some transactions - this isn't possible with cryptocurrencies

5. Potential to loose currency if the password is lost
// This is a really huge downside
