// Social impacts - aimed at left wing/progressive parties MPs

// Main points

1. Pyramid scheme - not an investment

2. Tax avoidance potential 

// Maybe again a shorter & longer version of this, the last 2 points are not hugely relevent to the main reasons bitcoin/PoW needs to go away.

Cryptocurrencies in their current form provide no useful benefits to end users and lacking any serious potential they have turned into huge pyramid schemes. Unlike an investment into a company Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have no mechanism of producing economic value, the only reason Bitcoin is worth $50000 today is the belief that it will be worth $60000 next month. This is clearly an unsustainable belief, however people are being decieved wholesale into "investing" large sums of money into cryptocurrencies on the back of get rich quick promises. Those who are fortunate enough to make substantial returns from cryptocurrencies are doing so off the back of newer "investors" with the money they invest being used to pay off those who invested earlier. A classic Ponzi scheme with a digital twist.

It goes without saying that at some point, the whole house of cards will come crashing down and when it does a lot of the newer investors will loose all their money.
