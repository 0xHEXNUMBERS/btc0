Initial action plan is as follows:

1. Create snippets for contacting representitives in different countries. (Use UK variants as the canonical copy and translate/update from their for other countries)
2. Turn snippets into full template letters, customised by party. 
3. Contact MPs and other representives 
4. Try to keep the dialog going with as many as possible by building a supply of reusable snippets to common responses
5. Once awareness is at a reasonable level, begin starting petitions using country specific tools (eg UK parliament petitions, EU citizens initiative, others?)
