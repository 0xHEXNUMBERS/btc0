Dear [TD],

// Brief intro i'm writing you as resident of your constituency, etc

I'm seriously concerned on the impact that cryptocurrencies are having on our society, generating negative externalities both at the environmental and the social level (the latest example being the ransomware attack on the HSE, enabled and spreading thanks the possibility of funneling money anonymously via cryptocurrencies).

Cryptocurrencies provide limited value to end consumers as virtually no merchants accept them as payment, however their quasi anonymous nature and the ability to sidestep traditional financial institutions make them a perfect form of payment for cybercriminals. As cryptocurrencies have grown in popularity and value so too has the rate of cybercrime, especially that of ransomware. Ransomware, typically takes the form of a virus which locks legitimate users out of computer systems and data demanding payment in cryptocurrency to return access. This form of attack can have deadly consequences with hospitals (see the damage done to the HSE today) and other public services being targeted alongside private companies and home users.Taking away the ease by which victims can pay attackers will significantly reduce the ability for criminals to profit from these crimes and go a long way in reducing their occurrence.
