Things to do

## Social media

- Do we want dedicated accounts or just use personal?
- Need to build up resources to use in social media discussions
- Repository of content which can be tweeted (e.g., infographics)

## Outreach

- Need to link up with other environmental groups; right now I think there must be a lack of awareness outside of tech about the exact impact of crypto currencies
and what can be done about them as I've barely seen anything from the key figures about them
- Fridays for future would be a good ally. 
- Good law project (UK) & ACLU (US) might be able to help with legal options
- Infosec persons, esp cryptographers might be able to help with some technical options. 

## Website

- Could just drop up a github.io page for now, if anyone wants to take point on this I can provide support
- Probably a good idea to get a real website at some point, but we can move from github fairly easily (Might be able to get free hosting/support from a company affected by miners)

## Company support

- Can we get some CI/Free hosting providers on board who are getting harmed by crypto mining?

## Media

- Create some press releases to send out to mainstream media organisations
- Find a few people who can speak to media on behalf of the project
